# Small RC Car
This project is referenced from [here](https://github.com/GungorYalcin/ArduinoDersleri/tree/master/gy_NodeMCU_Wifi_car_Blynk)

## Purpose
This project is to access RC car via Wifi
I used ESP8266 NodeMCU module.

## Pin Configuration
D1 —> EnA \
D2 —> IN1 \
D3 —> IN2 \
D4 —> IN3 \
D5 —> IN4 \
D6 —> ENB \
D7 —> Long pin of Led , Small pin will go to resistor and then to ground \
D8 —> Long pin of Led , Small pin will go to resistor and then to ground \
Rx —> Long pin of Led , Small pin will go to resistor and then to ground \
Tx —> Long pin of Led , Small pin will go to resistor and then to ground \

5V from motor controller to 3V NodeMCU

GND from motor controller to NodeMCU GND

All resistors used are 220ohm
